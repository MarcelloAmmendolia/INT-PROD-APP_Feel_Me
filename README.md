# INT-PROD-APP_Feel_Me
"Feel Me" is a wearable device with an attached app, developed to connect people far away from each other in a new and a more natural way.
Feel Me was created for the Hardware and Software course of Politecnico of Milan, held by Paolo Perego.

This prototype uses an Arduino Nano 33 IoT and a capacitative touch sensor to recive input from the user gestures and send messages accordingly. 
The idea was to make long distance friendships and relationships more playful, being able to easily send a message and check on your partner/friend.
