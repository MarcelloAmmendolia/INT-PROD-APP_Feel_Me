# INT-PROD-APP_Feel_Me
"Feel Me" is a wearable device with an attached app, developed to connect people far away from each other in a new and a more natural way.
Feel Me was created for the Hardware and Software course of Politecnico of Milan, held by Paolo Perego.

This prototype uses an Arduino Nano 33 IoT and a capacitative touch sensor to recive input from the user gestures and send messages accordingly. 
The idea was to make long distance friendships and relationships more playful, being able to easily send a message and check on your partner/friend.
The wrist-worn wearable device that allows users to send messages to one or more people's phones by touching areas of fabric that
are sewn directly onto the strap. Feel Me exploits a capacitive touch sensor to detect the user's touches and sends signals to the Arduino, 
which in turn exploits BLE communication to communicate with the bridge app developed by Professor Perego and thus the application made in Protopie.
There is also a buzzer, to give the user feedback about his actions, and a button to turn on and off the device.
The prototype is powered by a very small Li-Po battery, connected to a charging module that
guarantees the operation even without external power cable.
